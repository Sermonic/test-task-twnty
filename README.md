## Running the App Locally

1. **Clone the repository**: First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sermonic/test-task-twnty.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd test-task-twnty
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**: The next step is to install the project dependencies. If you're using npm, you can do this by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

   If you're using yarn, you can run:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Start the application**: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the application. If you're using npm, you can do this by running:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   If you're using yarn, you can run:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

   This command will start the application and open it in your default web browser. If the application doesn't open automatically, you can manually open it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
